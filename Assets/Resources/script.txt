ACTORA: I just... did my job. I hunted and killed across the galaxy. "Away on business", my wife would tell me. I was always on business. : Default
ACTORB: You never mentioned this before. Why now? : 
ACTORA: When my wife departed from her body, I attended to that issue. I left Kolyat in the care of his aunts and uncles. 
ACTORA: I have not seen him or talked to him since : 
ACTORB: That's not the choice I expected. Why didn't you raise him yourself?
